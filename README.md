**TomeBot**

***TOMEBOT IS NO LONGER UNDER DEVELOPMENT***
(And hasn't been for the past year and a half prior to announcing this.)

I wrote this discord bot primarily to gain an understanding about writing discord bots, to improve my skills with Python, and to have fun. At the time there weren't the same amazing D&D discord bots that exist today, and I'm delighted this got any of the attention that it did, even as such a rough around the edged project. I'm going to leave this repository here, however an official version of the bot is no longer being hosted. If people want to try resurrect it, go ahead, however if you just want a good discord bot for D&D I *highly* recommend Avrae https://avrae.io/
Avrae is essentially all I ever wanted TomeBot to be, but far futher along and developed by some passionate people, who more importantly have the time to work on such things, go check it out and contribute. (That's what I'm planning on doing.)
Thanks for the ride!

*old readme:*

TomeBot is currently in early alpha.
The goal is to produce a bot that uses the dnd 5e SRD, the pathfinder SRD and other SRDs from games with an OGL.
The bot is designed as a reference bot to make playing these pen and paper games easier,
you can use commands to look up spells and monsters, and current work in progress functions include group management and session scheduling.

My Discord server that the bot lives on if you want to test it:
https://discord.gg/25bf5NT

To add the current version of the bot to your discord server, use this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=247413966094073856&scope=bot&permissions=0

Also if you would like to mess with the source to make your own version of the bot go ahead,
make sure you use python 3.5 and install asyncio and discord.py with pip.
Also you will need to include a file called "token.json" and in it will need to include a discord api token for your bot user.

I'm not a lawyer, but if anyone from Wizards of the Coast are reading this and are unhappy with something let me know,
I'm trying to make sure the bot only uses SRD content but if anything needs removing just let me know and I can remove it.

*Note on uptime*
The bot will be running on a proper server once it has left the early alpha testing phase, and should hopefully have fairly decent uptime.
If you don't want to wait for a stable version of TomeBot feel free to use the source as I described to run your own version with your own discord bot account.
