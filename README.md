**TomeBot**

TomeBot is currently in early alpha.
The goal is to produce a bot that uses the dnd 5e SRD, the pathfinder SRD and other SRDs from games with an OGL.
The bot is designed as a reference bot to make playing these pen and paper games easier,
you can use commands to look up spells and monsters, and current work in progress functions include group management and session scheduling.

To add the current version of the bot to your discord server, use this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=247413966094073856&scope=bot&permissions=0

Also if you would like to mess with the source to make your own version of the bot go ahead,
make sure you use python 3.5 and install asyncio and discord.py with pip.
Also you will need to include a file called "token.json" and in it will need to include a discord api token for your bot user.

I'm not a lawyer, but if anyone from Wizards of the Coast are reading this and are unhappy with something let me know,
I'm trying to make sure the bot only uses SRD content but if anything needs removing just let me know and I can remove it.
